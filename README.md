# TerribleScripts</br>
Personal H3VR modding scripts. @ me on discord for features/fixes.

# Descriptions:

## HCBBoltStuff
### HCBBoltify
- Instantiates HCB Bolts a-la the Meatnailer.
- Needs companion script, `RoundHCBBoltType`, attached to your custom round, to work.
### TrepangExplodeyBolt
- Don't. Acts like an activated M340 when fired. Needs to be attached to a custom HCB Bolt round. Eats performance.
## WeaponModifications
### FakeMinigunSounds
- Nothing yet, intended to be a facsimile of the minigun's audio source logic functions for other firearm types.
### ReplenishFirearmMagazineAutomagically
- Replenish the firearm's magazine while holding down or toggling a button, with some other additional features.
- Put it somewhere in the firearm prefab.
- Half-finished. I forgot. I think.
### ToggleOnGrabRelease
- Toggles (enables or disables) objects of your choosing when your object is picked up or released.
### Duplicated Muzzle
- Basically fires the same rounds that your main muzzle fires w/o interacting with the magazine/chamber.
### Alternating Muzzle
- Switches multiple muzzles sequentially. Kinda like those horizontal volley guns.
### Sparks And Heat
- Evil plugin. Do not.
- Enables (and disables) a Particle Effect, an Audio Source and the Emissions Weight of a Mesh Renderer based on the Round Class currently loaded into the magazine of the firearm.
## Mod Mods
### AmmoCountUIColorShenanigans
- Takes Graphics, Line Renderers & LaserLight objects, Gradients, and puts the color onto the objects from the gradient based on the current ammo amount percentage.
## Animations
### Anim Play On Button Press
- Can use either A/X or B/Y for streamlined & any of the four touchpad directions for classic.
### Anim Play On Fire
- What it says on the tin.
### Anim Play On Mag Insert Eject
- The animations for insert and eject are separate (you can use the same one).
