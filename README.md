# TerribleScripts</br>
Personal H3VR modding scripts. @ me on discord for features/fixes, i don't check github that often.

# Descriptions:

## HCBBoltStuff
### HCBBoltify
- Instantiates HCB Bolts a-la the Meatnailer. 
- Needs companion script, `RoundHCBBoltType`, attached to your custom round, to work.
### TrepangExplodeyBolt
- Don't. Acts like an activated M340 when fired. Needs to be attached to a custom HCB Bolt round. Eats performance.
## WeaponModifications
### FakeMinigunSounds
- Nothing yet, intended to be a facsimile of the minigun's audio source logic functions for other firearm types.
### ReplenishFirearmMagazineAutomagically
- Replenish the firearm's magazine while holding down or toggling a button, with some other additional features.
- Put it somewhere in the firearm prefab.</br>
### ToggleOnGrabRelease
- Toggles (enables or disables) objects of your choosing when your object is picked up or released
### Duplicated Muzzle
- Do not.
- Basically fires the same rounds that your main muzzle fires w/o interacting with the magazine/chamber
## Mod Mods
### AmmoCountUIColorShenanigans
- Takes Graphics & LaserLight objects, Gradients, and puts the color onto the graphics/LL object from the gradient based on the current ammo amount percentage.
