# TerribleScripts</br>
Personal H3VR modding scripts. Mostly HCB Bolt stuff because nobody else has worked with them before, apparently.

# Descriptions:

## HCBBoltStuff
### HCBBoltify
- Instantiates HCB Bolts a-la the Meatnailer. 
- Needs companion script, `RoundHCBBoltType`, attached to your custom round, to work.
### TrepangExplodeyBolt
- Don't. Acts like an activated M340 when fired. Needs to be attached to a custom HCB Bolt round. Eats performance.
## WeaponModifications
### FakeMinigunSounds
- Nothing yet, intended to be a facsimile of the minigun's audio source logic functions for other firearm types.
### ReplenishFirearmMagazineAutomagically
- Replenish the firearm's magazine while holding down or toggling a button, with some other additional features.
- Put it somewhere in the firearm prefab.</br>
