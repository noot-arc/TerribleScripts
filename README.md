# TerribleScripts</br>
Currently includes:

### HCB Boltify</br>
Make any gun into an HCB Bolt firing one. Assign the script to the weapon GameObject and fill in the Firearm and HCB Bolt fields.</br>

Limitations:</br>
├ Fires null errors when worked with in Unity Editor. Doesn't do anything. 🤷‍♀️</br>
└ Can only use one HCB Bolt type, not dependant on the round. Will probably fix in the future.</br>


</br>
How to use:
Don't. Alternatively, in the Unity Editor, Meatkit > Scripts > Import Single > TerribleScripts.dll.
